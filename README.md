# Geco Habit Tracker

> Note: On first launch, if your terminal blocks standard input, the app will automatically assign "Guest" as the username to prevent crashing.

**Geco Habit Tracker** is a terminal-based Python application designed to help you build and maintain daily habits. \
The system is built around the idea of "not breaking the chain", a method of daily consistency tracking.
